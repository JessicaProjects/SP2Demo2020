	<h1>Profile</h1>
	<p>Jessica Delgado</p>
	<h2>Personal Information</h2>
	<p style="font-family: courier;">My name is Jessica, I am 28 years old and I currently do IT support for a government agency. I began my career as a plumber when I was 16, which after a couple of years I realized is not my ideal career path. I completed various IT courses over the span of 4 years and was able to secure employment in a helpdesk role. From there I have been able to perform various roles within the same organization.</p>
	<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
	<p style="font-family: courier;">My father sparked my interest in IT from a young age as he would sit me on his lap when I was six years old and he would work on his Macintosh II computer, futilely explaining the various features to me. I inherited his passion for technology from a young age, completing computer science subjects in high school in both senior years. Since my adolescence I have started my career in IT, doing IT support for NSW health in various roles over the span of 6 years.
	<br><br>I chose to come to RMIT to further my knowledge in Information Technology and help develop my career. While I have a lot of technical experience I would like to expand on that knowledge, helping me better understand the relation IT can have to businesses.
